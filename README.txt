Extra information on the project

The starting process of this project for me was learning
how to efficiently use git hub. It took a second but I figured 
it out. I felt like this was the way to start since everything 
else was dependant on git pushes and commits. Then I worked
in Jupyter notebook to create the code. This is the only way
I know how to edit python code and see if it works. I have 
not started this yet and I don't know how I am going to 
make the file work.
