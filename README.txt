Extra information on the project

The starting process of this project for me was learning
how to efficiently use git hub. It took a second but I figured 
it out. I felt like this was the way to start since everything 
else was dependant on git pushes and commits. Then I worked
in Nano with heavy reliance on the internet and our previous lessons. Overall
I feel like it could have gone way worse for me If i didnt come to your
help session and figured out the space problem.
